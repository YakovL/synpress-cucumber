// Problem 1:
//  while  npm run test:e2e  works (cypress run),  npm run test  (cypress open â†’ ...) fails with
//  "Cypress detected that you returned a promise from a command while also invoking one or more cy commands in that promise."
//  This complicates writing tests as with  cypress open  we have hot reloading and fast feedback loop when writing tests.
// Problem 2: .feature doesn't suggest boilerplates unlike Cucumber. Should we use cli to get that?
